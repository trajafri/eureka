# Eureka

Just some texts discussing bite sized CS topics.

Because of "C like syntax"'s popularity and my preference for a type system, the language used here mainly is
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), however I will probably also ask [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) to tag along in some cases.

Feel free to open issues/PR to suggest fixes/changes.
